# Bird-Classification
To classify bird species from a dataset of images, I followed a structured approach involving environment setup, data preparation, model creation, training, and evaluation. Initially, I set up the environment by installing necessary libraries and configuring the Kaggle setup, followed by downloading and unzipping the bird species dataset. I then loaded essential libraries and the dataset, processed image file paths and labels, and split the data into training and testing sets. To facilitate the training and validation process, I created data generators.

For the model, I utilized MobileNetV2 for transfer learning, adding custom layers for classification, and compiled the model. The model was then trained using the prepared data, leveraging the benefits of transfer learning to improve efficiency and accuracy. Post training, I evaluated the modelâ€™s performance on the test set, generating classification reports and confusion matrices. The results indicated satisfactory accuracy, demonstrating the model's capability to classify bird species effectively. Performance visualization through confusion matrices and classification reports provided insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement. Overall, the use of transfer learning with MobileNetV2 significantly enhanced the model's performance.
